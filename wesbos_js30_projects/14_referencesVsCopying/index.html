    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    //slice is one way to make a copy of an array when no arguments passed



    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);


    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // spread into that array. every item in that iterable is placed into the array!


    // another method using Array.from:
    const team5 = Array.from(players)


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    //this method creates a new object, then copies from the person object and then inputs desired attributes
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // this is very shallow because it will only go one level deep!
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos',
            facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    // this copies the wes object but only the first level (not the nest arrays)
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // this is a cheat to make a copy of an object by turning it into a string and then back into an object
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
